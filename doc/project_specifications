Final Demo Description:

The end demo will display a web-based club management system (title: STL Site) with fundamental
modules facilitating member and admin functionality. It will demonstrate the system's ability to handle
different member applications, attendance tracking, and documentation announcements, with variable
user access.

  Specific Feature to Present (High-Level Descriptions):

Role Based User Differentiation:
  ● Access by Admin (User Manager) and Interactive User
  ● Role-based dashboard visibility
Membership Application Module
  ● New member’s web form
  ● Backend data storage and validation
Attendance System
  ● QR code generation for meetings
  ● Attendance logging with history view
Post Announcements/Document Management
  ● Upload interface of admin-only file and project folder

  User Action(Triggers of Functional Flows):

Interactive User:
  ● Clicks on “Apply Now” on the homepage to trigger the membership application flow
  ● Submits the application form
User Manager:
  ● Logs in to continue with admin features
  ● Clicks on “Generate QR Code” to trigger a new meeting
  ● Views attendance record by selecting an old meeting

  Functional Components of the Application (Partial/Pseudo
Implementation):

Working Fully or with Real Backend:
  ● Submission of membership form:
    1. PHP validates proper input and stores in MariaDB
    2. Feedback on success/failure is shown
Tracking of attendance:
  ● PHP generates QR code using library(for example, PHP QR Code)
  ● Attendance data stored and retrieved from database
  ● Admin views past attendance records
Functional with Pseudo Implementation or UI Mockups:
  ● Role-based dashboard(if not implemented yet, can be displayed through static content or
  conditionally displayed views)
File/document upload module (can be stubbed to show upload interface without actually storing anything)
